title:  "Replying to Really Large Social Media Accounts"
---

Debating the wisdom of having replied to a massive account on Mastodon. It was a genuine response to the person, not a performative response to be seen by their followers.

Every response for a person with a massive following has to be the pelting of raindrops on a rooftop. I can't imagine them getting any meaningful connection that way, trying to see from their point of view. I also don't want to waste my effort only to get lost in a chorus either.

I've tried to avoid following massive infosec accounts there too, unless I view the account like the radio and not an actual person (and I feel guilty about reducing someone that way in my mind). I'm sure many are great people, but I don't want to make them or anyone strain to hear my whisper.
