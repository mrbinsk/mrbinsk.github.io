I used to have a Tumblr page at this address, because it was no-cost and I could post black and white photographs I liked to have **something** here in case someone checked out the URLs I attached to social media. The ads on that site weren't optimal, but I didn't want to pay a subscription fee for something I probably would update once or twice a year.

I've created this replacement on Github Pages to verify the link on my account on Mastodon. I'm also taking my "this should have been a blog post" length posts and posting them here for discoverability. Maybe if you clicked on my profile, you ended up here. If you did, here you go.
