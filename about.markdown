About pages can be hard. After all, are we what we do for a living? Are we where we went to school? Are we our job title? The house we live in? The car we drive?

For me, who somebody may be tends to shake out when they share their perspective on any number of issues. Do you care for your fellow human? Do you prefer your fellow humans at a distance?

I try and share my perspective judiciously and pseudonymously online, more recently on <a rel="me" href="https://infosec.exchange/@binsk">Mastodon</a>.

See you out there!

Elsewhere on Mastodon, I'm <a rel="me" href="https://bldg7.social/@binsk">here</a> and <a rel="me" href="https://defcon.social/@binsk">here</a> too, but not actively. Still figuring out where I'm going to end up.
